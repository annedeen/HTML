       <h3>History</h3>
       <hr>
      <p> Smallville is a small town in Kansas with a population of 45,000 people. When the meteor shower of 1989 occurred, it caused serious casualties and destruction to the town, while scattering around large quantities of radioactive green kryptonite and causing all sorts of mutations to the town's citizens. 
<br><br>
Smallville itself changed dramatically in the years following the first meteor shower. It was dubbed "America's Weirdest Town" by a national news magazine and it seemed that strange, unexplainable things were always taking place in the quiet hamlet that seemed so normal on the surface. So Smallville was soon called "The Meteor Capital Of The World!" Bizarre occurrences—such as a 150-pound tomato, a golden retriever that gave birth to a two-headed puppy and the miraculous recovery of a critically ill woman given no chance to survive by her doctors — became increasingly common in Smallville.<br><br>
